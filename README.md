This repository contains three Java programs that perform various operations on arrays.

**Part 1: Odd Even Separator**

This program takes user input to create two arrays, 'even' and 'odd,' segregating the entered numbers based on their parity (even or odd).

Usage:

Enter the number of elements.
Enter each element.
The program will display two arrays, one containing even numbers and the other containing odd numbers.


**Part 2: Nearest Neighbor Finder**

This program finds the index of the first number in an array with the smallest absolute distance to its neighboring number.

Usage:

Enter the number of elements in the array.
Enter each element.
The program will display the index of the first number with the smallest distance to its neighbor.


**Part 3: Array-ArrayList Conversion**


This program demonstrates the conversion of an array to an ArrayList and vice versa.

Usage:

Enter the number of elements in the array.
Enter each element.
The program will display the converted ArrayList and the array.
